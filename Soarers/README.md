# IBM-Soarers-Configs
 Personal soarer's configurations for the IBM Keyboards I own.

Special notes:

My 122-key needs some repairs so some keymappings maybe shifted unusually to compensate. Also uses an HHKB leftcontrol layout.

The Pingmaster has the HHKB control layout as well, what can I say its comfortable for gaming.
